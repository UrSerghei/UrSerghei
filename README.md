## About Me

  I’m a Data Science student at the University of Greenwich with a strong interest in machine learning, quantitative finance, and data analytics. I enjoy working with R, Python, SQL, data visualisation, and building models for time-series forecasting and predictive analysis.

Currently developing projects in ML, LSTM neural networks, technical indicators, and financial data modelling.

Focused on growing my skills in AI, statistics, and real-world data applications, and preparing for future internships and industry placements.
